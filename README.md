## Synopsis

A collection of short tutorials that demonstrate the use of code used to fit models discussed in papers.

## Tutorials

### fit_multi.md

Details the function used for the analysis of the Garden Bird Feeding Survey (GBFS) data provided by the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) in the paper "A spatio-temporal multi-species model of a semi-continuous response." C. M. Jones-Todd, B. Swallow, J. B. Illian, M. Toms. 2018. *Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series C (Applied Statistics)* 67 (3), 7005--722.

### CRC_point_process.md

Using cluster and void processes to model point patterns of tumour and stroma cell locations on slides from colon cancer patients. "Identifying prognostic structural features in tissue sections of colon cancer patients using point pattern analysis." C. M. Jones-Todd, P. Caie, J. B. Illian, B. C. Stevenson, A. Savage, D. J. Harrison, and J. L. Bown. 2018. DOI:10:1002/sim.8046

### shared_stochastic.md

Details the fitting of marked log-Gaussian Cox process models using an INLA-SPDE approach.

### species_distribution.md

Details for the fitting of the joint marked spatio-temporal LGCP model in "Estimating species distribution in highly dynamic populations using point process models" Redondo, S., et al.

The model described is fitted using the function **fit.marked.lgcp()** provided in the **R** package **lgcpSPDE**, which is available [here](https://github.com/cmjt/lgcpSPDE).

### diffusion.md

Supplementary material illustrating the fitting of the models discussed in **Detecting Subnational Diffusion Processes of Lethal Terrorism: Global Study, 2010-2016** *Andre Python, Janine Illian, Charlotte Jones-Todd, Mathias Thoenig, Ewan Cameron, and Marta Blangiardo* submitted 2018. Materials for the example given can be found [here](https://github.com/cmjt/examples/tree/master/materials).
