## Synopsis

A collection of short tutorials that demonstrate the use of code used to fit models discussed in papers.

## Tutorials

### fit_multi.md

Details the function used for the analysis of the Garden Bird Feeding Survey (GBFS) data provided by the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) in the paper `A spatio-temporal multi-species model of a semi-continuous response' to appear in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society series C.

### CRC_point_process.md

Details the functions used for colon rectal cancer patient data.

### shared_stochastic.md

Details the fitting of marked log-Gaussian Cox process models using an INLA-SPDE approach.

### Ecography_ESD.md

Details for the fitting of the joint marked spatio-temporal LGCP model in "Estimating species distribution in highly dynamic populations using point process models" Redondo, S., et al.

Please note that the model described can be fitted using the function **fit.marked.lgcp()** provided in the **R** package **lgcpSPDE**, which is available [here](https://github.com/cmjt/lgcpSPDE).
