## Synopsis

A collection of short tutorials that demonstrate the use of code used to fit models discussed in papers.

## Tutorials

### fit_multi.md

Details the function used for the analysis of the Garden Bird Feeding Survey (GBFS) data provided by the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) in the paper `A spatio-temporal multi-species model of a semi-continuous response' to appear in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society series C.

### CRC_point_process.md

Details the functions used for colon rectal cancer patient data.

### shared_stochastic.md

Details the fitting of marked log-Gaussian Cox process models using an INLA-SPDE approach.

### species_distribution.md

Details for the fitting of the joint marked spatio-temporal LGCP model in "Estimating species distribution in highly dynamic populations using point process models" Redondo, S., et al.

The model described is fitted using the function **fit.marked.lgcp()** provided in the **R** package **lgcpSPDE**, which is available [here](https://github.com/cmjt/lgcpSPDE).

### diffusion.md

Supplementary material illustrating the fitting of the models discussed in **Detecting Subnational Diffusion Processes of Lethal Terrorism: Global Study, 2010-2016** *Andre Python, Janine Illian, Charlotte Jones-Todd, Mathias Thoenig, Ewan Cameron, and Marta Blangiardo* submitted 2018. Materials for the example given can be found [here](https://github.com/cmjt/examples/tree/master/materials).
